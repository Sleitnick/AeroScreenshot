# Aero Screenshot
![Icon](ScreenshotTest2/AeroScreenshotIcon.png)

Capture, crop, save, and share screenshots.

I created this application so that I could streamline sharing screenshots to Twitter. I got frustrated with the process of
taking a screenshot, saving it, going to Twitter, and then browsing to find the picture. Now, I can quickly take a screenshot
and press CTRL+T (or click through the Share toolbar menus) to tweet out my picture.

This is my first C# application, so it is definitely not the prettiest, but it seems to work. Feel free to look through the code
and offer suggestions and critiques.
